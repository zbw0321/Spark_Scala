Problem 1
---
Given a directed graph, compute the average length of the out-going edges for each node, and sort the nodes first according to the average lengths in descending order and then according to the node IDs (numeric value) in ascending order.

Problem 2
---
Use the GraphX.
Given a directed graph and a node “t”, compute the number of nodes that are reachable from t in the graph.
